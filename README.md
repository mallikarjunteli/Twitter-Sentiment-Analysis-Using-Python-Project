# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Python-Project

The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project involves analyzing tweets to determine their sentiment, whether positive, negative, or neutral. Using Python, the project employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data. It then leverages machine learning models to classify the sentiments. The goal is to gain insights into public opinion and trends. The project also includes data visualization to present the results effectively.
